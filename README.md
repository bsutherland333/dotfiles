### My Dotfile Config

This repo contains the dotfiles I use for my personal Linux development configuration.

## Install scripts

# Install dotfiles

This will install all dotfiles found in this repo in their respecive locations. It will also download and update neovim plugins. It won't install system packages or do anything that would require sudo access.

# Install (dev) packages

This will install all the packages required for a headless development environment, like a server or docker container. It won't install things only needed on a desktop environment, like i3 or X11 packages.

TODO: Consider a desktop install script?
